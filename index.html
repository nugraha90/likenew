<p id="c78d" data-selectable-paragraph="">A sandstorm is coming to the Linux world as Finnish DJ Darude announced the release of his first Linux distro.</p>
<p id="e149" data-selectable-paragraph="">The distro, called &ldquo;DarudeOS&rdquo;, is based on Debian and promises to be &ldquo;the most powerful music-making tool&rdquo;. It comes with a custom music player that can play FLAC files, and a digital audio workstation preloaded with Eurodance samples.</p>
<p id="e183" data-selectable-paragraph="">The default wallpaper is, of course, a picture of Darude himself doing a &ldquo;wink and finger gun&rdquo;, and the default login sound is a sample of his famous song &ldquo;Sandstorm.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="9947" data-selectable-paragraph="">The announcement was met with mixed reactions on social media. Some people are excited to have a new music-centric distro besides Ubuntu Studio, while others are worried about the potential for ear damage.</p>
<p id="f7e7" data-selectable-paragraph="">We reached out to Darude for comment, but he was busy running down some stairs in Helsinki wearing a baggy vest.</p>
<p id="d2f6" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can download the DarudeOS ISO from his website,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk1u-zKSwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">dududududu.org</a>.</p>
<p id="a88e" data-selectable-paragraph="">His compatriot, Linus Torvalds, almost couldn&rsquo;t hold his excitement. &ldquo;This is fantastic news! I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Darude since his early days. His music is the perfect background noise for coding.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="b93b" data-selectable-paragraph="">&ldquo;I always knew that this day would come,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;You can tell that I designed Linux for audio because if you hold the shell up to your ear you hear the C.&rdquo; He then proceeded to do the worm.</p>
<p id="d961" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is not the first time an artist released a Linux distro. In 2006, Jamiroquai released JamOS. However, that distro was based on Red Hat and was not particularly well-received.</p>
<p id="6ede" data-selectable-paragraph="">We managed to get a hold of an early demo of DarudeOS, and we found three outstanding features:</p>
<h2 id="8e89" data-selectable-paragraph="">Special message from Darude on first boot.</h2>
<p id="7963" data-selectable-paragraph="">&ldquo;Hello my dude/dudette. It is me, Darude.</p>
<p id="c3f6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Yeah, I also can&rsquo;t believe that I made a Linux distro, but here we are.</p>
<p id="9ab2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Did you know I didn&rsquo;t came up with the &ldquo;Sandstorm&rdquo; melody by myself? The catchy sounds come from a very real and eternal sandstorm that encloses the gigantic desert at the end of spacetime. I accessed it on a wild peyote trip during a midnight sun in the arctic circle in 1997, and I just had to share the &ldquo;du du du&rdquo;s with the world.</p>
<p id="157f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Thank you for downloading this distro. I made it because I&rsquo;m tired of hearing people say that macOS is the operating system for creative people. I mean, what&rsquo;s up with that? You can be creative on any operating system &mdash; except Windows, which sucks.</p>
<p id="b03c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Also, how are you supposed to be a true artist and use an overpriced product made by the biggest company in the world? Is it only for artists trying to sell their souls for a bit of fame? I just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p id="1d7b" data-selectable-paragraph="">In any case, DarudeOS will take care of all your urges and desires. For extra creativity, we pre-installed three copies of the digital audio workstation Ardour. It takes a bit more disk space but, you have to admit, it&rsquo;s very rad.</p>
<p id="8f4c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Anyway, I have to go. My wife just came out of the sauna and wants a Salmiakki.</p>
<p id="3d84" data-selectable-paragraph="">Kiitos,<br />Darude&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="cdb9" data-selectable-paragraph="">Listening to dev/random.</h2>
<p id="6b83" data-selectable-paragraph="">&ldquo;/dev/random&rdquo; is a special file in Linux that produces random data. It is often used for cryptographic purposes, but it can be used for multiple things, like music generation.</p>
<p id="44c9" data-selectable-paragraph="">We found a desktop shortcut that plays &ldquo;/dev/random&rdquo; through the default music player. You get an infinite stream of noise that is, surprisingly, quite relaxing.</p>
<p id="20a0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Darude firmly believes that &ldquo;dev/random&rdquo; is a gateway to the universe.</p>
<p id="3398" data-selectable-paragraph="">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not exactly wrong,&rdquo; an MIT particle physicists told us, &ldquo;Any stream of random data has to pass through the quantum interface of reality &mdash; there&rsquo;s no telling what mysteries of the cosmos you might find. Our minds are not big enough to hold all that data, but you can definitely feel that there&rsquo;s something out there in the dev/random.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="9d95" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Darude Browser.</h2>
<p id="64d0" data-selectable-paragraph="">The default browser in DarudeOS is a version of Firefox that comes with a visualizer overlaying the entire screen. It generates visuals based on the current site.</p>
<p id="b31e" data-selectable-paragraph="">It looks quite nice, but if you have many tabs open, your browser looks like a rave that&rsquo;s going out of control.</p>
<p id="0356" data-selectable-paragraph="">After a few minutes, we even started to see images of vast deserts and pyramids. We contacted technical support about this, and they assured us that there are no 3D models of pyramids in the distro and that it&rsquo;s all in our &ldquo;mind&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="5ef5" data-selectable-paragraph="">They are aware of the issue, and they are &ldquo;working on a fix.&rdquo; In the meantime, they suggested we &ldquo;just enjoy the ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="0db5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Overall, we&rsquo;re quite impressed with DarudeOS. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see how this distro fares when it&rsquo;s released later this year. In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll be here listening to &ldquo;Sandstorm&rdquo; on repeat.</p>
